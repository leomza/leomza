Currently working as a Freelancer and at UpNext. I have two degrees in Business Management and in Accounting, but programming is my passion, I love it! I enjoy working with React, Angular, NodeJS and of course as databases I use MongoDB, MYSQL and Firebase. Something that I enjoy about programming is that you never stop to learn!
