### console.log('Hello World!!ðŸ‘‹')

I'm a programmer and also have two degrees, one in Business Management and in Accounting, but programming is my passion, I love it! I enjoy working with React, Angular, NodeJS and of course with databases like MongoDB, MYSQL and Firebase. One thing I enjoy about programming is that you never stop learning!
